## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I felt that this challenge was more a reinforcement of my knowledge versus a challenge that taught me new things. I wrote it up quickly and without much trouble.

The only part of this challenge that I felt I needed to fiddle with was relative positioning for the smaller icon images in my component. I noticed their positioning wasn't quite the same as on the given Figma design. It didn't take me long, but it was something I had to take a quick visit to Stack Overflow for. 

See below for the code snippet that I'm talking about:

```css
.icon-space {
    margin-right: .5em;
    position: relative;
    bottom: -0.2em;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to use the opportunity, while playing with projects that aren't that unfamiliar or difficult for me, to practice learning SASS or SCSS. I have a grasp of these css preprocessors, having watched tutorials, but I need to put my knowledge to the test with coding challenges.

### Useful resources

- https://stackoverflow.com/ - Of course, always a great addition in a dev's resource section. I feel that Stack Overflow is the very first website I go to whenever a piece of code is breaking, and I can't figure out why.
- https://www.w3schools.com/ - I regularly use this website to check my code's syntax.
